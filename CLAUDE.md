# Zero-Based Budget Tracker - iOS App

## Project Status: ✅ Production Ready

**Version**: 1.3.0  
**Last Updated**: November 2, 2025  
**Methodology**: YNAB-Style Zero-Based Budgeting  
**Technical Specification**: `Docs/TechnicalSpec.md`

## Project Overview

iOS budget tracking app implementing **YNAB-style zero-based budgeting** where you budget only money you currently have, giving every dollar a specific job. Built with SwiftUI and SwiftData.

**Core YNAB Principle**: Budget only money that exists TODAY, not money you expect to receive.

## YNAB-Style Budgeting Methodology

**CRITICAL: This app follows YNAB (You Need A Budget) principles. Understanding this methodology is essential for all development work.**

### Core Principles

#### Rule 1: Give Every Dollar a Job
**Budget only money you have RIGHT NOW, not money you expect to receive.**

- Start with current account balances (money that exists today)
- Assign ALL of that money to categories until "Ready to Assign" = $0
- Each category represents a "job" for your dollars (rent, groceries, savings, etc.)

#### Rule 2: Income Increases Ready to Assign
**Future income is NOT budgeted until it arrives.**

- When you receive a paycheck → log it as Income transaction
- It increases your "Ready to Assign" amount
- THEN you assign that new money to categories
- You're always working with money you HAVE, never money you EXPECT

#### Rule 3: The Budget Flow

```
Current Account Balance ($2,500)
    ↓
Ready to Assign: $2,500 (money available to budget)
    ↓
Assign to Categories (give each dollar a job)
    ↓
Ready to Assign: $0 ✅ (Goal achieved - all money assigned)
    ↓
Income Arrives → Log transaction → Increases Ready to Assign
    ↓
Assign new money to categories → Back to $0
```

### Key Implementation Rule

**❌ NEVER have "Monthly Income" or "Expected Income" sections**  
**✅ ONLY have "Ready to Assign" showing actual available money**

Income is logged when it ARRIVES via transactions, not pre-budgeted.

## Architecture

- **Framework**: SwiftUI for iOS 26
- **Persistence**: SwiftData (local-only storage, NO cloud sync)
- **Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Data Type**: Decimal for ALL monetary values (never Double/Float)
- **Charts**: Swift Charts for budget visualization
- **Notifications**: UNUserNotificationCenter for local push notifications

**Commit Message Format**: Conventional Commits
```
<type>: <description>

Examples:
fix: resolve CoreData errors on app startup
fix: show notification settings immediately on due date toggle
feat: add YNAB-style day-of-month due date picker
feat: reduce top whitespace across all tabs
feat: add pie chart visualization to Analysis view
refactor: extract chart components for better organization
```

**Commit Types**:
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `feat:` - New feature
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring without behavior change
- `docs:` - Documentation updates
- `test:` - Test additions/modifications
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `style:` - UI/UX styling changes

**Requirements**:
- Code must build successfully before committing
- Test the fix/feature manually before committing
- Update CLAUDE.md "Recent Significant Changes" after important commits
- Keep commit messages clear and descriptive

## Session Continuity Guide

### Starting a New Session

**Minimal Start** (same-day continuation):
```
Read CLAUDE.md "Active Development" section and continue with current focus.
```

**Standard Start** (after gap or new work):
```
1. Read CLAUDE.md "Active Development" section
2. Review "Active Issues & Enhancement Backlog" for current priority
3. Review git log --oneline -5 to see recent work
4. Continue with next unchecked task
```

**Full Start** (after interruption or uncertainty):
```
1. Read CLAUDE.md completely (especially YNAB methodology and active bugs)
2. Run: git log --oneline -10
3. Run: git status (check for uncommitted work)
4. Build project to verify working state
5. Report current status and next steps
```

### During Development

**Update "Active Development" section**:
- Change "Current Focus" when starting new bug/enhancement
- Add to "Recent Significant Changes" (keep last 5 only) when:
  - Fixing critical bugs
  - Completing enhancements
  - Major refactoring
  - Model schema changes
  - Version releases
- Update "Active Decisions/Blockers" if blocked or decision needed
- Update "Next Session Start Here" at end of session

**Do NOT**:
- Add blow-by-blow implementation details to session notes
- List every file changed (git handles that)
- Create detailed session logs with timestamps (git log handles that)
- Keep completed items in backlog (move to version history)

### After Interruption

Follow `Docs/ClaudeCodeResumption.md` for step-by-step recovery process.

## Critical Implementation Rules

**These rules apply to ALL development:**

1. **YNAB Methodology**: ALWAYS follow YNAB principles
   ```swift
   // ❌ WRONG - Budgeting expected income
   let monthlyIncome: Decimal = 5000
   
   // ✅ CORRECT - Budget only available money
   let readyToAssign: Decimal = (startingBalance + actualIncome) - totalAssigned
   ```

2. **Monetary Values**: Always use `Decimal` type (never Double or Float)
   ```swift
   var amount: Decimal  // ✅ Correct
   var amount: Double   // ❌ Wrong - causes rounding errors
   ```

3. **Local Storage**: All data stored on-device only
   ```swift
   ModelConfiguration(cloudKitDatabase: .none)  // ✅ Required
   ```

4. **Currency Formatting**: Use .currency format style consistently
   ```swift
   Text(amount, format: .currency(code: "USD"))  // ✅ Correct
   ```

5. **Relationships**: Cascade deletes where appropriate
   ```swift
   @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade) var transactions: [Transaction]
   ```

6. **Query Optimization**: Use #Index on frequently queried fields
   ```swift
   #Index<Transaction>([\.date], [\.category])
   ```

7. **Computed Properties**: Never store calculated values
   ```swift
   var total: Decimal { categories.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.amount } }  // ✅
   ```

8. **Income Tracking**: Income ONLY from transactions, never pre-budgeted
   ```swift
   // ✅ CORRECT - Calculate from actual transactions
   var totalIncome: Decimal {
       transactions.filter { $0.type == .income }.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.amount }
   }
   ```

9. **Zero Amounts Allowed**: Categories can have $0 budgeted (YNAB principle)
   ```swift
   // ✅ CORRECT - Allow $0 for unfunded but tracked expenses
   if amount >= 0 { /* Valid */ }
   ```

10. **Notifications**: Use UNUserNotificationCenter for local notifications
    ```swift
    // ✅ CORRECT - Local notifications that work when app closed
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().add(request)
    ```

11. **SwiftData Best Practices**: Follow iOS 26 SwiftData patterns
    ```swift
    // ✅ CORRECT - Explicit schema and configuration
    let schema = Schema([Transaction.self, BudgetCategory.self, MonthlyBudget.self])
    let config = ModelConfiguration(schema: schema, cloudKitDatabase: .none)
    let container = try ModelContainer(for: schema, configurations: [config])
    ```

## Issue & Enhancement Management

**Adding New Issues**:
1. Add to "Active Issues & Enhancement Backlog" with appropriate priority
2. Use 🔴 for critical bugs (Priority 1), 🟡 for UX improvements (Priority 2)
3. Use task checkboxes [ ] for tracking
4. Include clear acceptance criteria and test cases
5. Reference files to modify/investigate
6. Add implementation approaches and design considerations
7. **Verify it aligns with YNAB methodology**

**Completing Issues/Enhancements**:
1. Check off all related tasks [x]
2. Commit with descriptive fix:/feat: message
3. Add entry to "Recent Significant Changes"
4. Move completed item to version history (brief summary)
5. Update "Next Session Start Here" if needed
6. Test thoroughly before marking complete
7. Verify YNAB principles maintained (if applicable)

**Moving to Version History**:
- When bug/enhancement is complete, remove detailed tasks
- Add brief one-line summary to version history
- Keep backlog focused on ACTIVE work only

## Quick Reference

**Build Project**: `Cmd+B` in Xcode

**Check Git Status**: `git status`, `git log --oneline -10`

**Key Files to Review When Starting**:
- This file (CLAUDE.md) - current state, YNAB methodology, active issues
- Docs/TechnicalSpec.md - implementation patterns and best practices
- Docs/ClaudeCodeResumption.md - recovery from interruptions

**YNAB Methodology Quick Check**:
- ✅ Budgeting only money that exists today (not future income)?
- ✅ Income arrives via transactions (not pre-budgeted)?
- ✅ "Ready to Assign" prominently displayed?
- ✅ Goal to reach Ready to Assign = $0?
- ✅ Categories can be $0 (tracked but unfunded)?

**Common SwiftUI Debugging**:
- Console errors? Check error messages for root cause
- UI not updating? Verify @State/@Published property wrappers
- Sheet not appearing? Check binding and presentation logic
- Chart not rendering? Verify data structure and mark types
