# Zero-Based Budget Tracker - iOS App

## Project Status: ✅ Production Ready

**Version**: 1.8.1 (Light/Dark Theme Support)
**Last Updated**: November 6, 2025 (v1.8.1 Complete - 158 Unit Tests)
**Methodology**: YNAB-Style Zero-Based Budgeting
**Technical Specification**: `Docs/TechnicalSpec.md`

## Project Overview

iOS budget tracking app implementing **YNAB-style zero-based budgeting** where you budget only money you currently have, giving every dollar a specific job. Built with SwiftUI and SwiftData.

**Core YNAB Principle**: Budget only money that exists TODAY, not money you expect to receive.

## YNAB-Style Budgeting Methodology

**CRITICAL: This app follows YNAB (You Need A Budget) principles. Understanding this methodology is essential for all development work.**

### Core Principles

#### Rule 1: Give Every Dollar a Job
**Budget only money you have RIGHT NOW, not money you expect to receive.**

- Start with current account balances (money that exists today)
- Assign ALL of that money to categories until "Ready to Assign" = $0
- Each category represents a "job" for your dollars (rent, groceries, savings, etc.)

#### Rule 2: Income Increases Ready to Assign
**Future income is NOT budgeted until it arrives.**

- When you receive a paycheck → log it as Income transaction
- It increases your "Ready to Assign" amount
- THEN you assign that new money to categories
- You're always working with money you HAVE, never money you EXPECT

#### Rule 3: The Budget Flow

```
Current Account Balance ($2,500)
    ↓
Ready to Assign: $2,500 (money available to budget)
    ↓
Assign to Categories (give each dollar a job)
    ↓
Ready to Assign: $0 ✅ (Goal achieved - all money assigned)
    ↓
Income Arrives → Log transaction → Increases Ready to Assign
    ↓
Assign new money to categories → Back to $0
```

### Key Implementation Rule

**❌ NEVER have "Monthly Income" or "Expected Income" sections**  
**✅ ONLY have "Ready to Assign" showing actual available money**

Income is logged when it ARRIVES via transactions, not pre-budgeted.

## Architecture

- **Framework**: SwiftUI for iOS 26
- **Platform**: iPhone only (iOS 26+) - iPad and other platforms not supported
- **Persistence**: SwiftData (local-only storage, NO cloud sync)
- **Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Data Type**: Decimal for ALL monetary values (never Double/Float)
- **Charts**: Swift Charts for budget visualization
- **Notifications**: UNUserNotificationCenter for local push notifications
- **Orientation**: Portrait mode optimized (landscape functional but not primary design)

## Session Continuity Guide

### Starting a New Session

**Quick Start** (continuing recent work):
```
1. Read CLAUDE.md "Next Session Start Here" section
2. Continue with current enhancement or start next one
```

**Standard Start** (after gap or new context):
```
1. Read CLAUDE.md "Active Development" + "Enhancement Backlog"
2. Run: git log --oneline -5
3. Run: Smoke tests only (see Test Execution Strategy below)
4. Start work on highest priority enhancement
```

**Full Start** (after interruption or major context switch):
```
1. Read CLAUDE.md completely (focus on YNAB methodology if needed)
2. Run: git log --oneline -10 && git status
3. Run: xcodebuild build (verify project compiles)
4. Run: Smoke tests (not full suite unless required)
5. Review "Active Development" section for current state
6. Report findings and proceed with next enhancement
```

**Note**: The "Next Session Start Here" section is specifically designed to give you immediate context without reading the entire file. Use smoke tests by default to conserve tokens unless working on model/YNAB logic changes.

### During Development

**Update "Active Development" section**:
- Change "Current Focus" when starting new bug/enhancement
- Add to "Recent Significant Changes" (keep last 5 only) when:
  - Fixing critical bugs
  - Completing enhancements
  - Major refactoring
  - Model schema changes
  - Version releases
- Update "Active Decisions/Blockers" if blocked or decision needed
- Update "Next Session Start Here" at end of session

**Do NOT**:
- Add blow-by-blow implementation details to session notes
- List every file changed (git handles that)
- Create detailed session logs with timestamps (git log handles that)
- Keep completed items in backlog (move to version history)

### After Interruption

Follow `Docs/ClaudeCodeResumption.md` for step-by-step recovery process.

## Critical Implementation Rules

**These rules apply to ALL development:**

1. **YNAB Methodology**: ALWAYS follow YNAB principles
   ```swift
   // ❌ WRONG - Budgeting expected income
   let monthlyIncome: Decimal = 5000
   
   // ✅ CORRECT - Budget only available money
   let readyToAssign: Decimal = (startingBalance + actualIncome) - totalAssigned
   ```

2. **Monetary Values**: Always use `Decimal` type (never Double or Float)
   ```swift
   var amount: Decimal  // ✅ Correct
   var amount: Double   // ❌ Wrong - causes rounding errors
   ```

3. **Local Storage**: All data stored on-device only
   ```swift
   ModelConfiguration(cloudKitDatabase: .none)  // ✅ Required
   ```

4. **Currency Formatting**: Use .currency format style consistently
   ```swift
   Text(amount, format: .currency(code: "USD"))  // ✅ Correct
   ```

5. **Relationships**: Cascade deletes where appropriate
   ```swift
   @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade) var transactions: [Transaction]
   ```

6. **Query Optimization**: Use #Index on frequently queried fields
   ```swift
   #Index<Transaction>([\.date], [\.category])
   ```

7. **Computed Properties**: Never store calculated values
   ```swift
   var total: Decimal { categories.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.amount } }  // ✅
   ```

8. **Income Tracking**: Income ONLY from transactions, never pre-budgeted
   ```swift
   // ✅ CORRECT - Calculate from actual transactions
   var totalIncome: Decimal {
       transactions.filter { $0.type == .income }.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.amount }
   }
   ```

9. **Zero Amounts Allowed**: Categories can have $0 budgeted (YNAB principle)
   ```swift
   // ✅ CORRECT - Allow $0 for unfunded but tracked expenses
   if amount >= 0 { /* Valid */ }
   ```

10. **Notifications**: Use UNUserNotificationCenter for local notifications
    ```swift
    // ✅ CORRECT - Local notifications that work when app closed
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().add(request)
    ```

11. **SwiftData Best Practices**: Follow iOS 26 SwiftData patterns
    ```swift
    // ✅ CORRECT - Explicit schema and configuration
    let schema = Schema([Transaction.self, BudgetCategory.self, MonthlyBudget.self])
    let config = ModelConfiguration(schema: schema, cloudKitDatabase: .none)
    let container = try ModelContainer(for: schema, configurations: [config])
    ```

## Issue & Enhancement Management

**Priority Levels**:
- 🔴 **Priority 1**: Critical bugs (app crashes, data loss, core functionality broken)
- 🟡 **Priority 2**: UX improvements (usability issues, polish, refinements)
- 🟢 **Priority 3**: New features (enhancements, additional functionality)

**Adding New Issues/Enhancements**:
1. Add to "Active Issues & Enhancement Backlog" with appropriate priority emoji
2. Use comprehensive format for Priority 3 features:
   - Objective (clear goal statement)
   - YNAB Alignment Check (ensure methodology compliance)
   - Implementation Approach (technical strategy)
   - Files to Create/Modify (specific file paths)
   - Design Considerations (UX/architecture decisions)
   - Testing Checklist (comprehensive test cases)
   - Acceptance Criteria (definition of done)
3. Use task checkboxes [ ] for all actionable items
4. Include code examples where helpful
5. Reference specific file paths with line numbers if applicable
6. **Always verify alignment with YNAB methodology**

**Completing Issues/Enhancements**:
1. Check off all related tasks [x] as you complete them
2. Commit after each logical unit with descriptive fix:/feat: message
3. Add entry to "Recent Significant Changes" (keep last 5)
4. Move completed item to version history (brief one-line summary)
5. Update "Next Session Start Here" for continuity
6. Test thoroughly before marking complete (follow testing checklist)
7. Verify YNAB principles maintained (if applicable)
8. Update version number if releasing (x.y.z format)

**Moving to Version History**:
- When enhancement is complete, remove detailed specifications
- Add brief one-line summary to appropriate version section
- Keep backlog focused on ACTIVE work only
- Archive detailed specs if needed for future reference

## Quick Reference

**Build Project**: `Cmd+B` in Xcode or `xcodebuild -project ZeroBasedBudget.xcodeproj -scheme ZeroBasedBudget build`

**Check Git Status**: `git status`, `git log --oneline -10`

**Test Execution Strategy** (Token Efficiency):

**Run Smoke Tests** (~15-20 tests, <5 seconds) - **USE THIS FOR MOST CHANGES**:
- UI-only changes, icon theming, layout adjustments, color updates
- Documentation updates, minor bug fixes
- Command: `xcodebuild test -scheme ZeroBasedBudget -only-testing:ZeroBasedBudgetTests/SmokeTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'`

**Run Targeted Tests** (specific suite based on change):
- Model changes: `xcodebuild test -only-testing:ZeroBasedBudgetTests/Models -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'`
- YNAB logic: `xcodebuild test -only-testing:ZeroBasedBudgetTests/YNAB/YNABMethodologyTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'`
- Calculations: `xcodebuild test -only-testing:ZeroBasedBudgetTests/Utilities/BudgetCalculationsTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'`
- Themes: `xcodebuild test -only-testing:ZeroBasedBudgetTests/Utilities/ThemeManagerTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'`

**Run Full Suite** (140 tests, ~30-45 seconds) - **USE SPARINGLY**:
- Version releases, major refactoring, schema changes, explicit user request
- Command: `xcodebuild test -scheme ZeroBasedBudget -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'`

**Decision Tree for Test Selection**:
1. Changed model schemas or YNAB calculations? → **Full Suite**
2. Changed specific utility functions? → **Run that utility's tests + smoke tests**
3. Only changed UI/colors/layout? → **Smoke tests only**
4. Version release or PR? → **Full suite**
5. User explicitly asked for tests? → **Full suite**
6. Unsure? → **Smoke tests first, then targeted if issues found**

**Key Files to Review When Starting**:
- This file (CLAUDE.md) - current state, YNAB methodology, active issues
- Docs/TechnicalSpec.md - implementation patterns and best practices
- Docs/ClaudeCodeResumption.md - recovery from interruptions

**YNAB Methodology Quick Check**:
- ✅ Budgeting only money that exists today (not future income)?
- ✅ Income arrives via transactions (not pre-budgeted)?
- ✅ "Ready to Assign" prominently displayed?
- ✅ Goal to reach Ready to Assign = $0?
- ✅ Categories can be $0 (tracked but unfunded)?

**Common SwiftUI Debugging**:
- Console errors? Check error messages for root cause
- UI not updating? Verify @State/@Published property wrappers
- Sheet not appearing? Check binding and presentation logic
- Chart not rendering? Verify data structure and mark types
